This application allows you view and interact with select hydrologic data collected at 29 stream,  river, and lake inflow/outflow sites across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  NEON spans the continential United States and includes monitoring sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. In this app you can visually explore data from the following NEON Data Products:

* Stage-discharge rating curves [(DP4.00133.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00133.001)
* Continuous discharge [(DP4.00130.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00130.001)
* Precipitation [(DP1.00006.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00006.001)
* Land-water interface images [(DP1.20002.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.20002.001)

## App Dependencies

The shiny app downloads published data from the [NEON Data Portal](https://data.neonscience.org/home) using the [neonUtilities](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities) package. Users must have the neonUtilities (available in [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neonUtilities/index.html)) package installed to run the app.

The shiny app uses the [neonStageQPlot](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/tree/master/neonStageQPlot) package. The neonStageQPlot package is not available in CRAN and must be installed directly from Github:

`devtools::install_github(repo = "NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/neonStageQPlot", dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)`

## Step by Step Install Guide

1. Install the newest version of the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [RStudio desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) Open Source Edition.
2. Go to the [NEON-stream-discharge repository](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge) then click the green code button in the top right and click Download Zip.
3. Unzip the file then within the folder double click the NEON-stream-discharge R project file which will then open RStudio. In the bottom right panel navigate into the shiny-openFlow folder and click app.R.
4. app.R will open in the panel on the top left of RStudio. Then a banner will appear asking you to install required packages click install and wait for the packages to install, this will take some time. 
5. Look at the top left panel then click the Run App button at the top right and wait for the app to install dependencies from GitHub then the app will launch. 

## Other Content in the shiny-openFlow Folder

* .Rmd file `about.Rmd` contains a user guide for the openFlow app that describes the inputs, outputs, and features of the app. This .Rmd file is rendered in the openFlow app in the "About the App" tab.

* Data frame `aqu_dischargeDomainSiteList.csv` contains a list of the NEON domains and site IDs that have continuous discharge data published to the NEON Data Portal. The data frame also contains metadata for each site that is rendered in the application.
		
*	.Rds file `rcPlottingData.rds` contains the data needed to plot the posterior rating curve with associated uncertainties.
