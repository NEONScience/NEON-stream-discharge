	<h2>About the Gauge Height Calulcator</h2>
		<p>This tab calculates the gauge height from levelTROLLS/aquaTROLLS pressure data from the L0 database</p>
	
	<h1>How to use this tab:</h1>
		<li>Choose a domain and site.</li>
		<li>Choose a water type; GW (ground water) or SW (surface water)</li>
		<li>Choose a locaiton. This is site dependent. (see notes for examples)</li>
		<li>Select the date range for the L0 pressure readings.</li>
		<li>Select whether L0 data will be used or a single pressure reading</li>
		
	<h1>Important Notes:</h1>
		<li>If L0 selected is set to "Yes", there will be the option to upload a .csv file, the program will default to using it as long as it exists</li>
		<li>When GW is selected as the water type there will be two input boxes for the well depths and troll cable length, <strong>both must be filled in</strong> otherwise they should be left blank. 
			Leaving them blank will result in the water column height above the GWW troll excluding water depth underneath it.
			Additionally, GWW data results in water column height instead of a calculated gauge height.</li>
		<li>L0 data formatting from the <a href = "https://den-prodissom-1.ci.neoninternal.org/blizzard/">L0 data viewer tab</a> of Blizzard is accepted in this program, Grafana is still a work in progress</li>
