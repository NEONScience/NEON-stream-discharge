## <span style="color: #2F5597;"><b>Overview</b></span>

Welcome to openFlow! This application allows you view and interact with select hydrologic data collected at 29 stream,  river, and lake inflow/outflow sites across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  NEON spans the continential United States and includes monitoring sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. In this app you can visually explore data from the following NEON Data Products:

* Stage-discharge rating curves [(DP4.00133.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00133.001)
* Continuous discharge [(DP4.00130.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00130.001)
* Precipitation [(DP1.00006.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00006.001)
* Land-water interface images [(DP1.20002.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.20002.001)
* Stream morphology maps [(DP4.00131.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00131.001)

To learn more about each data product, follow the links above to data product landing pages and navigate to the 'Documents' section to find either Data Product User Guides (DPUG) or Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBD) for each data product.

The openFlow app consists of three separate tabs that work separately and together to be a one-stop-shop for interpreting NEON hydrology data.

1. Timeseries Viewer
2. Target Gauge Height
3. Real-Time Data Viewer

## <span style="color: #2F5597;"><b>Time Series Viewer</b></span>

### Inputs

To run the timeseries viewer, users must select a NEON **Domain ID** and **Site ID** from dropdown menus and specify a **Date Range** to download and plot data. Visit the NEON website to learn more [About Field Sites and Domains](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/about-field-sites) and [Explore Field Sites](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/explore-field-sites).

The following checkbox inputs can be toggled either before or after a user selects 'Submit'.

**Include Discharge Science Review Quality Flags** - If selected, shaded areas (grey) will plot in the background of the plotting field for time ranges when DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:dischargeFinalQFSciRvw = 1.

**Convert to Imperial Units** - If selected, data in the 'Continuous Discharge' and 'Rating Curve(s)' tabs will be converted to imperial units. Units (Metric, Imperial) for the main groups of variables are:

* Discharge (liters per second, cubic feet per second)
* Stage (meters, feet)
* Precipitation (millimeters, inches)

<!-- **Show in Dark Mode** - If selected, the app will have a global dark theme. -->

### Outputs

#### Metadata Table

The metadata table contains the following reach-scale variables that characterize the site that was selected:

* **Upstream watershed area (km^2^)** - The area of land that drains water into the aquatic site.
* **Reach slope (%)** - The gradient of the streambed from the upstream to downstream reach boundary of the aquatic site. Slope is measured using a total station during topographic site surveys.
* **Mean bankfull width (m)** - The mean bankfull width of the channel measured at transects throughout the monitoring reach. At bankfull stage water is just beginning to spill out of the channel and into the floodplain. Bankfull flows typically occur at 1.5-year recurrence intervals.
* **D50 particle size (mm)** - The diameter of bed substrate corresponding to 50% finer in the particle-size distribution. Substrate is measured at transects throughout the monitoring reach using 200-point pebble count methods.

_**Note:**_  At NEON river sites (BLWA, FLNT, TOMB), reach slope, mean bankfull width, and D50 particle size are not measured. Also, at the Toolik Lake (TOOK) inflow and outflow locations, D50 particle size is not measured.

#### The 'Continuous Discharge' Tab

In the 'Continuous Discharge' tab, a timeseries plot is generated that plots three groups of data:

**Discharge**

* Continuous discharge (black line) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:maxpostDischarge and DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:continuousDischarge
* Discharge Parametric Uncertainty (orange ribbon) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:withParaUncQLower2Std and DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:withParaUncQUpper2Std
* Discharge Remnant Uncertainy (dark orange ribbon) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:withRemnUncQLower2Std and DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:withRemnUncQUpper2Std
* Measured Discharge (green point) - derived from DP4.00133.001:sdrc\_gaugeDischargeMeas:streamDischarge
* Historic Median Discharge\* (grey line) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:maxpostDischarge and DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:continuousDischarge
* Three Times Median Discharge\*\* (dashed grey line) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:maxpostDischarge and DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:continuousDischarge

**Stage**

* Continuous Stage (pink line) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:equivalentStage
* Stage Uncertainty (blue ribbon) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:stageUnc
* Measured Gauge Height (yellow point) - DP4.00133.001:sdrc\_gaugeDischargeMeas:gaugeHeight and DP4.00130.001:sdrc\_gaugePressureRelationship:gaugeHeight

**Precipitation**\*\*\*

* Continuous Precipitation (blue line) - DP1.00006.001:PRIPRE\_5min:priPrecipBulk *or* DP1.00006.001:SECPRE\_1min:secPrecipBulk
* Precipitation Uncertainty (purple ribbon) - DP1.00006.001:PRIPRE\_5min:priPrecipExpUncert *or* DP1.00006.001:SECPRE\_1min:secPrecipExpUncert

<font size="1">\* - Historic Median Discharge is calculated from all RELEASED data at a given site. [Click here](https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-revisions-releases) to learn more about NEON data releases.</font> 

<font size="1">\*\* - Three Times Historic Median Discharge is also calculated from all RELEASED data at a given site. The discharge value (\+\/\- uncertainty) is reported at the top of the plot. The grey dashed line plotted is 3x median discharge plus uncertainty. If data completeness and/or validity is lacking for a site, users can view comparable USGS data. If available, the app will provide a link to the closest USGS proxy site and a 3x median discharge to use.</font> 

<font size="1">\*\*\* - The app defaults to primary prcipitation (DP1.00006.001:PRIPRE\_5min) when plotting data from the Precipitation data product. If no primary precipitation data is available for a site, the app will plot secondary precipitation (DP1.00006.001:SECPRE\_1min). Preciptiation data product is not published for all NEON aquatic sites. If precipitation data is not published for a NEON aquatic site, openFlow will report data from the nearest co-located NEON terrestrial site. The site ID from which the precipitation data is pulled is included in the legend.  [Click here](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/about-field-sites) to learn more about co-located NEON sites.</font> 

All continuous data and uncertainties are averaged and plotted at a 20 minute temporal resolution regardless of the temporal resolution at which an attribute is published.

Users can view the publication status of the timeseries viewed by hovering over the shaded bars rendered just above the x-axis. Users can view and identify data that has been RELEASED, that is currently PROVISIONAL, and data that is UNPUBLISHED.

If there are no data published for an attribute in a given time range, the attribute will not be visible in the legend. 

#### The 'Rating Curve(s)' Tab

In the 'Rating Curve(s)' tab, a plot is generated that shows all stage-discharge rating curves used to model continuous discharge for the time range specified by the user. Continuous discharge and stage-discharge rating curve data are linked by the **curveID** field. The app will identify all unique **curveID** values within the range of continuous discharge data and plot the stage-discharge relationship (black points), rating curve (black line), and uncertainties (parametric uncertainty = orange ribbon, remnant uncertainty = dark orange ribbon) for each rating curve.

### Features

#### Plotly Features

Plotting in the openFlow app is done using the [_plotly_ R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/plotly.pdf). Plots created in _plotly_ contain built-in functionality that allow users to better interact and interpret data. The plots in the openFlow app contain the following useful functionality built into the plots:

* Click and drag on the plot to zoom in and  double click to autoscale both axes.
* Toggle visibility of attributes by clicking on them in the legend (double click on a legend attribute to view only this attribute in the plot. 
  + In the 'Continuous Discharge' tab, Continuous Discharge, Continuous Stage, Measured Discharge, and Measured Gauge Height attributes default to _on_ while all other attributes default to _off_.
  + In the 'Rating Curve(s)' tab, Rating Curve w/ Gaugings attribute defaults to _on_ and Uncertainty defaults to _off_.
* Change discharge scales between linear and log using the buttons above the legend.
* Hover over attributes on the plotting field to see values at specific timestamps.

#### Render PhenoCam Image

* In the 'Continuous Discharge' tab, users can hover over any plot attribute and click to render an image of the site published in the [PhenoCam Gallery](https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/). Images are queried from the PhenoCam API for the timestamp closest to the timestamp clicked by the user.

#### Download Handler

* In the 'Continuous Discharge' and 'Rating Curve(s)' tabs, users can download the plots as HTML files. When the plots are rendered in the app, a 'Download Graph' button will appear in the lefthand panel of the app above the Metadata Table. If downloaded, the HTML file will retain all the interactive functionality built into _plotly_. _**Note:**_ Users that download data for larger date ranges (> 6 months) will experience longer wait times.

* Users can also download PhenoCam images. When PhenoCam images render in a new window, users can click the 'Download Phenocam Image' button to save the image as a PNG file.

## <span style="color: #2F5597;"><b>Target Gauge Height</b></span>

### Background

The required number of annual discharge bouts at AQU stream and lake inflow/outflow sites has been reduced from 24 to 22. With this change, Domains are to attempt to collect 2 additional measurements each year during periods of high flow, when water levels are within +10% to -30% of the designated target stage. Targeted discharge bouts are a high priority when a site is experiencing high flows (see Field Prioritization Matrix, OSProcedure-specific-priorities for details).

High flows near bankfull stage historically occur on 1.5 year intervals, though this frequency is expected to change as extreme weather events (e.g. heat waves and large storms) become more frequent and more intense. Field Science staff should not enter the channel when high flows are present; ADCP instrumentation should always be used to measure high flow discharge as it can be safely deployed from the floodplain. Contact Science with any questions regarding the target gauge height values, the time periods in which they historically occur, and/or strategies to assist with forecasting these stochastic events.

### Reported Values

The reported values provides the range of staff gauge heights at which high flow discharge measurements should be targeted and the time period in which they have historically occurred. Note that target gauge height values will change if staff gauges are replaced (Science will then update the values following a total station survey of the staff gauge and the discharge cross-section).

### The Visuals

#### Rating Curve Plot

The lefthand plot shows the most recently-published stage discharge rating curve with the target gauge range higlighted in <b><span style="color: darkgreen;">green</span></b> showing (from lower to higher stage) the \-30\% threshold, the target gauge height, and the \+10\% threshold.

#### Discharge Cross Section Plot

The righthand plot shows the most recently-surveyed discharge cross-section. The cross section is 'filled' to the target gauge height, with the horizontal black bars showing the \-30\% - \+10\% range of gauge heights.

<center><img src="www/targetgaginterp.png" width="800px" /></center>

<center><font size="2">Interpreting the Target Gauge Height outputs: The plots reveal where the target gauge range fall within the rating curve and the discharge cross section. The blue arrows point to the -30% threshold, the yellow arrows point to the target gague height, and the red arrows point to the +10% threshold</font></center>

## <span style="color: #2F5597;"><b>Real-Time Data Viewer</b></span>

### Inputs

In addition to selecting a NEON Domain ID and Site ID, users must **'Select TROLL Type'** that is used to collect data at the staff gauge and discharge location (all domains except D18/19 use LevelTroll). 

There are three data input options that allow users to get a near-real time discharge estimate:

* **Single Staff Gauge Reading** - Users can enter a raw staff gauge reading, which is then offset and converted to estimated discharge.
* **Single Pressure Reading** - Users can enter a raw pressure reading, which is calibrated, converted to water column height, modeled to estimated stage, and converted to estimated discharge.
* **Grafana CSV File** - Users can enter a timeseries of raw staff gauge readings downloaded from a Grafana dashboard visualization. The timeseries is then calibrated, converted to water column height, modeled to estimated stage, and converted to estimated discharge.

Users are referred to the [Guide to Assessing 3x Median Discharge at NEON Sites](https://neoninc.sharepoint.com/sites/fopscollaboration/AQU%20Only%20Documents/Forms/Active%20Docs.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Ffopscollaboration%2FAQU%20Only%20Documents%2FdischargeToolsFor3xMedian%5F20230315%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Ffopscollaboration%2FAQU%20Only%20Documents) for more details on how to enter different data types into openFlow's Real-Time Data Viewer.

### Outputs

#### Single Readings

If users enter a single reading (gauge height or raw pressure), the outputs will be a snapshot with static values and plot. 

#### Raw Pressure Timeseries

If users upload a raw pressure timeseries, the output visuals will be dynamic and linked to provide a holistic view of how stage and discharge are changing at a site in real time.

#### The Visuals

**Rating Curve Plot**

The upper plot shows the most recently-published stage discharge rating curve with the following additions:

* The estimated output discharge plotted as a horizontal <b><span style="color: black;">dashed black line</span></b>
* The current 3x median discharge value plotted as a horizontal <b><span style="color: red;">dashed red line</span></b>
* The target gauge range (See the 'Target Gauge Height' tab) higlighted in <b><span style="color: darkgreen;">green</span></b> showing (from lower to higher stage) the -30% threshold, the target gauge height, and the +10% threshold

**Discharge Cross Section Plot**

The lower plot shows the most recently-surveyed discharge cross-section. The cross section is 'filled' to the level of the estimated discharge output.

**Linked Plots**

When hovering on the timeseries plot along the x-axis, the two lower plots will change the highlighted output discharge estimate as the position on the timeseries x-axis changes. In the rating curve plot, the black dashed line will move up and down the y-axis (discharge) as the users hovers along the timeseries. Equivalently, the cross-section plot will 'fill' and 'empty' as the user hovers along the timeseries.

<center><img src="www/rtdvinterp.png" width="800px" /></center>

<center><font size="2">Interpreting the Real-Time Data Viewer outputs: The discharge value that is reported from a single reading or that is currently highlighted in the timeseries will render in the rating curve plot as a horizontal dashed black line. The stream stage that that discharge corresponds to will be shown as how 'full' the channel is in the discharge cross section plot.</font></center>
