<font size="10">**Welcome to openFlow!**</font> 

## Overview

This application allows you view and interact with select hydrologic data collected at 29 stream,  river, and lake inflow/outflow sites across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  NEON spans the continential United States and includes monitoring sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. In this app you can visually explore data from the following NEON Data Products:

* Stage-discharge rating curves [(DP4.00133.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00133.001)
* Continuous discharge [(DP4.00130.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00130.001)
* Precipitation [(DP1.00006.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00006.001)
* Land-water interface images [(DP1.20002.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.20002.001)

To learn more about each data product, follow the links above to data product landing pages and navigate to the 'Documents' section to find either Data Product User Guides (DPUG) or Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBD) for each data product.

## Using the App

### Inputs

#### Before 'Submit'

To run the app, users must select a NEON **Domain ID** and **Site ID** from dropdown menus and specify a **Date Range** to download and plot data. Visit the NEON website to learn more [About Field Sites and Domains](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/about-field-sites) and [Explore Field Sites](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/explore-field-sites).

_**Note:**_ The openFlow app uses the [_neonUtilities_ R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neonUtilities/index.html) to download data from the NEON API. Users that select larger date ranges (> 6 months) will experience longer wait times.

Users also have the option to enter their **NEON API Token** before running the app to link their app activity to their user account and enable faster download speeds. Learn more about the benefits of using an API token [here](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial).

#### Independent of 'Submit'

The following checkbox inputs can be toggled either before or after a user selects 'Submit'.

**Include Discharge Science Review Quality Flags** - If selected, shaded areas (grey) will plot in the background of the plotting field for time ranges when DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:dischargeFinalQFSciRvw = 1.

**Convert to Imperial Units** - If selected, data in the 'Continuous Discharge' and 'Rating Curve(s)' tabs will be converted to imperial units. Units (Metric, Imperial) for the main groups of variables are:

* Discharge (liters per second, cubic feet per second)
* Stage (meters, feet)
* Precipitation (millimeters, inches)

**Show in Dark Mode** - If selected, the app will have a global dark theme.

### Outputs

#### Metadata Table

The metadata table contains the following reach-scale variables that characterize the site that was selected:

**Upstream watershed area (km^2^)** - The area of land that drains water into the aquatic site.

**Reach slope (%)** - The gradient of the streambed from the upstream to downstream reach boundary of the aquatic site. Slope is measured using a total station during topographic site surveys.

**Mean bankfull width (m)** - The mean bankfull width of the channel measured at transects throughout the monitoring reach. At bankfull stage water is just beginning to spill out of the channel and into the floodplain. Bankfull flows typically occur at 1.5-year recurrence intervals.

**D50 particle size (mm)** - The diameter of bed substrate corresponding to 50% finer in the particle-size distribution. Substrate is measured at transects throughout the monitoring reach using 200-point pebble count methods.

_**Note:**_  At NEON river sites (BLWA, FLNT, TOMB), reach slope, mean bankfull width, and D50 particle size are not measured. Also, at the Toolik Lake (TOOK) inflow and outflow locations, D50 particle size is not measured.

#### The 'Continuous Discharge' Tab

In the 'Continuous Discharge' tab, a timeseries plot is generated that plots three groups of data:

**Discharge**

* Continuous discharge (black line) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:maxpostDischarge
* Discharge Parametric Uncertainty (orange ribbon) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:withParaUncQLower2Std and DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:withParaUncQUpper2Std
* Discharge Remnant Uncertainy (dark orange ribbon) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:withRemnUncQLower2Std and DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:withRemnUncQUpper2Std
* Measured Discharge (green point) - derived from DP4.00133.001:sdrc\_gaugeDischargeMeas:streamDischarge
* Historic Median Discharge\* (grey line) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:maxpostDischarge.
* Three Times Median Discharge\*\* (dashed grey line) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:maxpostDischarge

**Stage**

* Continuous Stage (pink line) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:equivalentStage
* Stage Uncertainty (blue ribbon) - derived from DP4.00130.001:csd\_continuousDischarge:stageUnc
* Measured Gauge Height (yellow point) - DP4.00133.001:sdrc\_gaugeDischargeMeas:gaugeHeight and DP4.00130.001:sdrc\_gaugePressureRelationship:gaugeHeight

**Precipitation**\*\*\*

* Continuous Precipitation (blue line) - DP1.00006.001:PRIPRE\_5min:priPrecipBulk *or* DP1.00006.001:SECPRE\_1min:secPrecipBulk
* Precipitation Uncertainty (purple ribbon) - DP1.00006.001:PRIPRE\_5min:priPrecipExpUncert *or* DP1.00006.001:SECPRE\_1min:secPrecipExpUncert

<font size="2">\* - Historic Median Discharge is calculated from all RELEASED data at a given site. [Click here](https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-revisions-releases) to learn more about NEON data releases.</font> 

<font size="2">\*\* - Three Times Historic Median Discharge is also calculated from all RELEASED data at a given site. The discharge value (\+\/\- uncertainty) is reported at the top of the plot. The grey dashed line plotted is 3x median discharge plus uncertainty. If data completeness and/or validity is lacking for a site, users can view comparable USGS data. If available, the app will provide a link to the closest USGS proxy site and a 3x median discharge to use.</font> 

<font size="2">\*\*\* - The app defaults to primary prcipitation (DP1.00006.001:PRIPRE\_5min) when plotting data from the Precipitation data product. If no primary precipitation data is available for a site, the app will plot secondary precipitation (DP1.00006.001:SECPRE\_1min).</font> 

**Table:** The Preciptiation data product is not published for all NEON aquatic sites. If precipitation data is not published for a NEON aquatic site, the _neonUtilities_ R package will pull data from the nearest co-located NEON terrestrial site. The site ID from which the precipitation data is pulled is included in the legend.  [Click here](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/about-field-sites) to learn more about co-located NEON sites.

All continuous data and uncertainties are averaged and plotted at a 20 minute temporal resolution regardless of the temporal resolution at which an attribute is published.

If there are no data published for an attribute in a given time range, the attribute will not be visible in the legend. 

#### The 'Rating Curve(s)' Tab

In the 'Rating Curve(s)' tab, a plot is generated that shows all stage-discharge rating curves used to model continuous discharge for the time range specified by the user. Continuous discharge and stage-discharge rating curve data are linked by the **curveID** field. The app will identify all unique **curveID** values within the range of continuous discharge data and plot the stage-discharge relationship (black points), rating curve (black line), and uncertainties (parametric uncertainty = orange ribbon, remnant uncertainty = dark orange ribbon) for each rating curve.

### Features

#### Plotly Features

Plotting in the openFlow app is done using the [_plotly_ R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/plotly.pdf). Plots created in _plotly_ contain built-in functionality that allow users to better interact and interpret data. The plots in the openFlow app contain the following useful functionality built into the plots:

* Click and drag on the plot to zoom in and  double click to autoscale both axes.
* Toggle visibility of attributes by clicking on them in the legend (double click on a legend attribute to view only this attribute in the plot. 
  + In the 'Continuous Discharge' tab, Continuous Discharge, Continuous Stage, Measured Discharge, and Measured Gauge Height attributes default to _on_ while all other attributes default to _off_.
  + In the 'Rating Curve(s)' tab, Rating Curve w/ Gaugings attribute defaults to _on_ and Uncertainty defaults to _off_.
* Change discharge scales between linear and log using the buttons above the legend.
* Hover over attributes on the plotting field to see values at specific timestamps.

#### Render PhenoCam Image

* In the 'Continuous Discharge' tab, users can hover over any plot attribute and click to render an image of the site published in the [PhenoCam Gallery](https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/). Images are queried from the PhenoCam API for the timestamp closest to the timestamp clicked by the user.

#### Download Handler

* In the 'Continuous Discharge' and 'Rating Curve(s)' tabs, users can download the plots as HTML files. When the plots are rendered in the app, a 'Download Graph' button will appear in the lefthand panel of the app above the Metadata Table. If downloaded, the HTML file will retain all the interactive functionality built into _plotly_. _**Note:**_ Users that download data for larger date ranges (> 6 months) will experience longer wait times.

* Users can also download PhenoCam images. When PhenoCam images render in a new window, users can click the 'Download Phenocam Image' button to save the image as a PNG file.
