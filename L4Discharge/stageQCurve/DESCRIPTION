Description: The stageQCurve package can be used for calculating a stage-discharge rating curve using the same procedure described in NEON User Guide to Stream Discharge Rating Curve, revision A. Briefly, the NEON stage-discharge rating curve is developed using a Bayesian modeling technique developed by the Bayesian Rating Curve Advanced Graphical Environment (BaRatinAGE) development team (Le Coz et al., 2013; Le Coz et al., 2014). The executable and/or a GUI is available freely with an individual license by sending an email to: baratin.dev@lists.irstea.fr.
